# OnePlus 3/3T Front Camera fix

This module has to be used with a modified Google Camera, recommended versions for OnePlus 3/3T are the ones from [Arnova8G2](https://www.celsoazevedo.com/files/android/google-camera/dev-arnova8G2/) and [Toylan009](https://www.celsoazevedo.com/files/android/google-camera/dev-tolyan009/); you can also use the ones from [Urnyx05](https://www.celsoazevedo.com/files/android/google-camera/dev-urnyx05/) and [MarcAnt01](https://www.celsoazevedo.com/files/android/google-camera/dev-marcant01/).

On OnePlus 3T only (not on 3) it increases the resolution of photos taken with front camera from 4 MP to 16 MP.
On GCams from some devs (not the ones above) it enables HDR+, portrait mode, RAW, etc, on the front camera, stopping the app from crashing.

## How about compatibility?

This module works with Magisk 17.0+ and Android 7.0+ (both Oxygen OS and Custom Roms are supported).

## How does it work?

It fixes some libraries which are placed in ``` system/vendor/lib ```
